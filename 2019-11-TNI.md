## Define

Small pieces, hundres. 
-> microservices

we're using a proof of concept for this; eventually will be more than hundres of applications

we do not want to share the architecture that is our IP
it's a single system with one call back

several systems

application is broken down into a very low level.... each step of the application is broken up into a microservice.

nginx - message router
containerized - loadbalancing
ngingx - route - target service


have to be scalable model - for current and future

shopping cart, customer registration, billing - all different URI - although, same app.
